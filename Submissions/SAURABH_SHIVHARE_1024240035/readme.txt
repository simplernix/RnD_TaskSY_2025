Inspired by my customisation of arch hyprland setup going for aesthetic lavender/light purple theme

pressing ctrl+k toggles the clock widget on webpage 

clicking the game icon opens bonk.io one of my personal favourite game sites

and the terminal icon opens the hyprland setup i forked

also used v0.dev for a basic blueprint and then modified w grok since i dont know much of webdev
